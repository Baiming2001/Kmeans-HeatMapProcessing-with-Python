# Project-in-BachelorTime
selfmade

This Project created by Python includes two parts, one part is to read and process the date from Excel, another part is to cluster them with K-Means and draw the tables. 
In series of 2 to K (the input max amount of cluster center), it will finally produce (K-1) kinds of Solution, each for the situation of different amount of cluster centers. The coordinate of cluster center will be present. Also a series of tables including locations of cluster centers and distribution target point will be created. In the end there are also a table figuring the average cost of each Solution, so we can find the best Amount of clustering Center and their Coordinates.
